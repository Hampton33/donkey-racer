# Compilation
1. Follow the appropriate operating-system-specific environment setup on https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment
2. If you are on Windows, ensure that your Vulkan SDK path is pointed to in the Makefile.
3. In a terminal inside the project directory run "make" or "mingw32-make" depending on your environment.
4. The server is written in Rust so run "cargo build" inside of server directory.
